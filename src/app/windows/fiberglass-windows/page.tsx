    intro: "Frisco homeowners seeking the pinnacle of window performance choose fiberglass for its unmatched combination of structural strength, superior thermal efficiency, and authentic wood aesthetics. In a city with luxury architecture from historic bungalows to modern developments, fiberglass windows provide the ultimate durability and energy performance that discerning Frisco residents demand.",

    sections: [
      {
        heading: 'Unrivaled Structural Strength for Frisco Homes',
        content: "Fiberglass is fundamentally stronger than any other window frame material, making it ideal for Frisco\&apos;s occasional severe weather and hail storms. The material\&apos;s tensile strength exceeds steel while maintaining flexibility that prevents cracking during temperature extremes. Unlike vinyl that can become brittle or wood that warps, fiberglass maintains perfect alignment and smooth operation year-round in Frisco\&apos;s variable climate.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Superior Thermal Performance Reduces Costs',
        content: "Fiberglass\&apos;s naturally low thermal conductivity creates exceptional insulating properties that significantly reduce energy costs in Frisco\&apos;s hot summers. The material conducts heat 500 times slower than aluminum and far better than wood, creating a natural thermal barrier. Frisco homeowners typically see 35-45% reductions in heating and cooling costs with fiberglass windows.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Authentic Wood Beauty Without Maintenance',
        content: "Modern fiberglass windows replicate the natural beauty of wood with stunning accuracy, yet require none of the maintenance that authentic wood demands in Frisco\&apos;s climate. Advanced manufacturing creates wood-grain textures virtually indistinguishable from real wood, perfect for Frisco\&apos;s historic neighborhoods while eliminating annual refinishing requirements.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Moisture Resistance for Texas Climate',
        content: "Fiberglass is inherently moisture-resistant, making it perfect for Frisco\&apos;s humid summers and occasional heavy rains. Unlike wood that absorbs moisture and rots, fiberglass remains impervious to water damage. The material never needs sealing or protective treatments, preventing mold and mildew growth that can compromise indoor air quality.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Design Flexibility and Customization',
        content: "Fiberglass\&apos;s workability allows manufacturers to create virtually any window style, size, or configuration. The material accommodates complex curves and irregular shapes that would be difficult with other materials. Available in unlimited color options, fiberglass windows match Frisco\&apos;s diverse architectural styles from traditional ranch homes to contemporary designs.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Environmental and Health Advantages',
        content: "Fiberglass represents a responsible choice for environmentally conscious Frisco homeowners. The material is 100% recyclable and requires no toxic preservatives. Long service life means fewer replacements over time, reducing manufacturing impacts. For families concerned about health and environmental impact, fiberglass windows provide premium performance with lower ecological footprint.",
